This repository showcases a common but subtle bug in C++ related to `std::vector<bool>`.  When accessing elements of a `std::vector<bool>`, an out-of-bounds index may not trigger an exception as it does with other vector types. This can lead to unpredictable behavior and difficult-to-track errors. The `bug.cpp` file demonstrates this issue, while `bugSolution.cpp` provides a safer alternative.
